# Visualizer

I just wanted to see if i could replicate the project shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4t_-NjY_Sg)
This project currently only has the AStar algorithm implemented.

# Future Work

* The animation could be made better.
* Additional features like adding weights and dragging the goal/start after the algo has finished could be implemented.
